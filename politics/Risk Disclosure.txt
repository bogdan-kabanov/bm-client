Risks disclosure for operations with foreign currency and derivatives — Block Mind

This short warning, being an addition to the General Business Terms, is not intended to mention all risks and other important aspects of operations with foreign currency and derivatives. Considering the risks, you should not settle transactions of the aforementioned products if you are not aware of the nature of the contracts you enter into, the legal aspects of such relations within the context of such contracts, or the degree of your exposure to risk. Operations with foreign currency and derivatives are connected with a high level of risk, therefore they are not suitable for many people. You have to thoroughly evaluate to what extent such operations are suitable for you, taking into consideration your experience, aims, financial resources and other important factors.

1. Operations with foreign currency and derivatives
1.1 Leveraged trading

Leveraged trading means that potential profits are magnified; it also means that losses are magnified. The lower the margin requirement, the higher the risk of potential losses if the market moves against you. Sometimes margins required can be as little as 0.5%.
Be aware that when trading using margin, your losses can exceed your initial payment, and it is possible to lose much more money than you initially invested.

Relatively inconsiderable market movements will have proportionally increasing impact on the amounts deposited, or intended to be deposited by you. This may work either for you or against you.

If the market moves against your position, Block Mind may require you to urgently deposit additional funds. Failure to do so may result in forced closing of your positions, and you will bear responsibility for any resulting losses.

1.2 Orders and risk-reduction strategies

Certain orders (e.g., stop-loss or stop-limit) may turn out to be inefficient if the market conditions prevent their execution (for example, low liquidity).
Strategies using combinations of positions (spread, straddle, etc.) may not be less risky than simple long or short positions.

2. Additional risks specific to foreign currency and derivatives transactions
2.1 Contract conditions

You must obtain from your broker detailed information regarding obligations, execution terms, and settlement conditions (e.g., option expiration and exercise limitations).
Under certain circumstances, exchanges may change contract requirements to reflect market changes.

2.2 Suspension or restriction of trade

Market conditions (e.g., illiquidity) or exchange rules (e.g., price limits) may make executing transactions difficult or impossible. This may result in increased losses.

2.3 Deposited funds and property

You should familiarize yourself with protective instruments that apply to your deposited security (money or other assets). Recovery of funds depends on local legislation and the standards of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty operates.

2.4 Commission fees and charges

Before trading, you must clearly understand all commissions, fees, and charges. These will affect your net profit or loss.

2.5 Transactions in other jurisdictions

Trading in foreign markets may expose you to additional risks. Local regulators may not enforce foreign regulatory rules.

2.6 Currency risks

Transactions denominated in a foreign currency are affected by exchange rate fluctuations.

2.7 Liquidity risk

If assets cannot be traded when needed, you may face losses or inability to close/open positions. Margin requirements may force you to add funds immediately.

2.8 Stop-loss limits

Stop-loss orders may not always be effective due to gaps or rapid price movements.

2.9 Execution risk

There may be a lag between order placement and execution. Prices may differ from expected, especially when trading while markets are closed.

2.10 Counterparty risk

This is the risk that the counterparty issuing the CFD defaults. If funds are not segregated, you may not receive your money back.

2.11 Trading systems

Electronic systems may fail. Recovery of losses depends on the liability limits of the system providers.

2.12 Electronic trading

Electronic trading platforms have specific risks (system failure, order issues, margin requirement delays, etc.).

2.13 Over-the-counter operations

OTC operations may involve difficulty closing positions, estimating value, or determining fair pricing. Regulation may be weaker.
